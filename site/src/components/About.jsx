                <p>I'm a guy in my mid 30's that decided to change my career during lockdown. I quit my job working in a freezer and decided to try and dedicate myself to becoming a developer.

My thought process behind the site is to showcase but also keep a record of thing's I've created and the steps I've taken to get to my current level </p>

                <h2>WHAT I'M DOING</h2>
                <p>
I'm building things! What things? I'm not entirely sure yet but I've been enjoying building tools to suit a variety of use cases in the meantime and it's my intention to maintain this page with things I've built either way.</p>

My goal right now is simple. To become a better developer</p>
