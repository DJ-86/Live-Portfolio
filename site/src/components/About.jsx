                <p>I'm a guy in my mid 30's that decided to change my career during lockdown. I quit my job working in a freezer and began researching careers that one could self-teach. I enjoy problem solving and as a gamer, already spend loads of time on my PC so the path of becoming a developer was appealing. Looking back, I realise I had very little idea of what the scope of being a developer truly was.

After bumbling my way through more than a few tutorials, I was becoming frustrated with my progress - I felt like I was learning syntax but not doing much problem solving. I read some advice to the effect of "Build things and follow less tutorials". By that time, I had learned the basics of HTML and CSS and had been struggling with JavaScript for a while but thought I'd give it a go, so I built my house calculator. I knew it was basic but I was immensely proud of putting theory into practice.</p>

                <p>
I'm building things! What things? I'm not entirely sure yet but I've been enjoying building tools to suit a variety of use cases in the meantime and it's my intention to maintain this page with things I've built either way.</p>

                <p>
My goal right now is simple. To become employed as a developer. It is a large goal but one I will continue to pursue until I achieve it.</p>
